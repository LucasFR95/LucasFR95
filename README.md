Hi everyone! My name is Lucas and I'm from Niteroi-RJ, Brazil. I'm currently studying Information Systems at Universidade Federal Fluminense(UFF). Also I'm studying anything related to back-end developer, specfic about NodeJs. But I like to make projects related to front-end as well. In this profile you will find my college projects and personal projects.
